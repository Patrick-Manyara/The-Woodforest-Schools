                                    As students transition into Junior Secondary School, our program evolves to meet their changing needs. The curriculum becomes more challenging, preparing them for the academic rigors of high school. Beyond academics, our Middle School program encourages personal growth, leadership skills, and a sense of responsibility, laying the groundwork for success in future endeavors. Our students have the chance to engage in activities that enhance their personal growth and contribute to the community.
